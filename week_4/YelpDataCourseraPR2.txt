Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000

	|   4.0 |    69 |
	|   4.5 |    17 |
	|   5.0 |    23 |
	+-------+-------+


7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SELECT
	id
	, name
	, review_count
	FROM user
	ORDER BY review_count DESC
	LIMIT 3;
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

	+------------------------+--------+--------------+
	| id                     | name   | review_count |
	+------------------------+--------+--------------+
	| -G7Zkl1wIWBBmD0KRy_sCw | Gerald |         2000 |
	| -3s52C4zL_DHRK0ULG6qtg | Sara   |         1629 |
	| -8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg | Yuri   |         1339 |
	+------------------------+--------+--------------+
		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Yes, these variables appear to be moderately correlated. I manually calculated the R^2 value between these two columns to be 0.43. This means that 43% of the variance between the number of reviews posted and the number of fans for a given user is explained by a simple linear model.

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

	I ran the following the query:

	SELECT avg((review_count - x_avg) * (fans - y_avg)) * avg((review_count - x_avg) * (fans - y_avg)) / (x_variance * y_variance) AS R2
	FROM user
		,(
			SELECT x_avg
				,y_avg
				,AVG((review_count - x_avg) * (review_count - x_avg)) AS x_variance
				,AVG((fans - y_avg) * (fans - y_avg)) AS y_variance
			FROM user
				,(
					SELECT AVG(review_count) AS x_avg
						,AVG(fans) AS y_avg
					FROM user
					)
			);
	
	This was the output:

	+----------------+
	|             R2 |
	+----------------+
	| 0.437136492915 |
	+----------------+

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM review
	WHERE text LIKE "%love%"

	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM review
	WHERE text LIKE "%hate%"

	+----------+
	| COUNT(*) |
	+----------+
	|      232 |
	+----------+

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

There is a slight difference in the distribution. It looks like more restaurants with lower ratings are open early in the work-week. This is because one of the restaurants, Edulis is not open on Mondays. It is hard to make solid conclusions because the sample size is small.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
Out of the four restaurants, the two highly rated restaurants had review counts of 89 and 8. The lower rated restaurants have review counts on 5 and 34.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

No, each of the four restaurants is in a difference postal_code.

SQL code used for analysis:


SELECT 
	B.name,
	B.review_count,
	H.hours,
	postal_code,
	CASE
		WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN 1
		WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN 2
		WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN 3
		WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN 4
		WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN 5
		WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN 6
		WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN 7
	END AS day,
	CASE
		WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN 'LOW'
		WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN 'HIGH'
	END AS rating
FROM business B INNER JOIN hours H
ON B.id = H.business_id
INNER JOIN category C
ON C.business_id = B.id
WHERE (B.city == 'Toronto'
AND
C.category LIKE 'restaurants')
AND
(B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3
OR
B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
GROUP BY stars,day
ORDER BY day,rating ASC

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

The businesses that are open have on average more reviews than the ones that are closed.         
         
ii. Difference 2:

The businesses that are open have a slightly higher star rating than the ones that are closed.

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I will analyze the data to build a model for predicting is a business will be open or closed. This is a binary classification problem.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

 I am taking this class in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and I am witnessing many local businesses around me closing. It would be interesting to see if the data from Yelp can be used to build a model to predict if a given business will remain open or closed. As a binary classification problem, I can used models like logistic regression. The data for this model will be basic descriptors of the business like its name, location, city, etc which will not be directly used in the model as well as metrics such as the number of reviews, its average rating, etc. The response variable will be a boolean: is_open. I wanted to do one-hot encoding using case statements with the categories and attributes for the businesses. Unfortunately, there are just too many distinct values, so I'll do this with the pandas library in Python.                         
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
